**App description:** This interactive app allows you to visualize the murder statistics in the US from the `USArrests` dataset. This dataset is available as a preloaded dataset in R.

**App features**:

- Feature 1 - Add a map of the US to the UI. This can be useful for users to visualize geographical location of the states and also make the app more visually interesting.

- Feature 3 - Add an interactive table. This can be useful to help users to quickly view the exact arrest numbers, compare the rate between the different states, and view states within a chosen arrest range.

- Feature 4 - Add sidebarPanel and mainPanel to reorganize the page to make it more visually aesthetic.
